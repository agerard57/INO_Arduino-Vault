## Detailled description

Using a keypad and a 7-seg display, I wanted to make a kind of vault that is locked until the correct password is entered.
The user can interact with the keypad and the button. An audible sound can be heard when:

- Entering any number
- Pressing the "C" button
- Entering the right password
- Entering the wrong password
- Resetting the password.

When the correct password is found, nothing happens except an audio cue.
You could add, later down the road, something that will be triggered with this cue (like a led, a motor or an electronical lock).

The letters and symbols aren't used, except for "**C**", who will clear the user's input.

Misc: It uses EÂ²PROM to store the correct password. The latter can be changed if the button is held for 3 seconds.
